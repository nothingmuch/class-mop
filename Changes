Revision history for Perl extension Class-MOP.

0.63 Mon July 7, 2008
    * Class::MOP
      - load_class will initialize a metaclass even if
        the class is already loaded (sartak)
      - load_class now returns the metaclass instance
        instead of just 1 (sartak)

    * elsewhere
      - better error messages (sartak and Dave Rolsky)

0.62 Wed June 18, 2008
    - in is_class_loaded, recognize scalar references (as opposed to globs) in
      the symbol table as methods (these are optimized constant subs)

0.61 Fri. June 13, 2008
    - Okay, lets give this another try and see if PAUSE 
      recognizes it correct this time.

0.60 Thurs. Jun 12, 2008
    - Fixed a version number issue by bumping all modules
      to 0.60.

0.59 Thurs. Jun 12, 2008
    !! Several fixes resulting in yet another 25-30% speedup !!

    * Class::MOP::Class
      - now stores the instance of the instance 
        metaclass to avoid needless recomputation
        and deletes it when the cache is blown
      - introduce methods to query Class::MOP::Class for 
        the options used to make it immutable as well as
        the proper immutable transformer. (groditi)        

    * Class::MOP::Package
      - {add, has, get, remove}_package_symbol all 
        now accept a HASH ref argument as well as the
        string. All internal usages now use the HASH
        ref version.

    * Class::MOP
      - MOP.xs does sanity checks on the coderef 
        to avoid a segfault
      - is_class_loaded check now uses code that
        was improved in Moose's ClassName type
        check (Sartak)
      - nonsensical (undef, empty, reference) class
        names now throw a more direct error in
        load_class (Sartak)
        - tests for this and other aspects of
          load_class (Sartak)
    
    * Class::MOP
      Class::MOP::Class      
      Class::MOP::Method
      Class::MOP::Method::Wrapped
      Class::MOP::Attribute
      - switched usage of reftype to ref because 
        it is much faster

0.58 Thurs. May 29, 2008
    (late night release engineering)--
    
    - fixing the version is META.yml, no functional 
      changes in this release

0.57 Wed. May 28, 2008
    !! Several speedups resulting in 20-25% speedups !!
    || (thanks to konobi, groditi, mst & CataMoose) !!

    * Class::MOP::Class
      - made get_method_map use list_all_package_symbols
        instead of manually grabbing each symbol
      - streamlining &initialize somewhat, since it gets
        called so much
        
    * Class::MOP::Package
      - made {get, has}_package_symbol not call 
        &namespace so much 
      - inlining a few calls to &name with 
        direct HASH access key access
      - added get_all_package_symbols to fetch 
        a HASH of items based on a type filter
        similar to list_all_package_symbols
        - added tests for this

    * Class::MOP::Method
      Class::MOP::Method::Constructor
      Class::MOP::Method::Generated
      Class::MOP::Method::Accessor
      - added more descriptive error message to help 
        keep people from wasting time tracking an error
        that is easily fixed by upgrading.

    * Class::MOP::Immutable
      - Don't inline a destructor unless the user actually
        needs one
        - added tests for this

0.56 Saturday, May 24, 2008
    * Class::MOP
      - we now get the &check_package_cache_flag
        function from MRO::Compat
      - All XS based functionality now has a 
        Pure Perl alternative
        - the CLASS_MOP_NO_XS environment variable
          can now be used to force non-XS versions
          to always be used

    * Class::MOP::Attribute
      - add has_read_method and has_write_method
      - get_{read,write}_method_ref now wraps the
        anon-sub ref in the method metaclass when
        possible
        - added tests for this

    * Class::MOP::Immutable
      - added the ability to "wrap" methods when
        making the class immutable

    * Class::MOP::Class
      - now handling the edge case of ->meta->identifier
        dying by wrapping add_package_symbol to specifically
        allow for it to work.
        - added tests for this

    * Class::MOP::Attribute
      Class::MOP::Class
      Class::MOP::Immutable
      - any time a method meta object is constructed
        we make sure to pass the correct package and
        method name information

    * Class::MOP::Method
      Class::MOP::Method::Wrapped
      Class::MOP::Method::Generated
      Class::MOP::Method::Accessor
      Class::MOP::Method::Consructor
      - the &wrap constructor method now requires that a 
        'package_name' and 'name' attribute are passed. This 
        is to help support the no-XS version, and will 
        throw an error if these are not supplied.      
      - all these classes are now bootstrapped properly
        and now store the package_name and name attributes
        correctly as well        

    ~ Build.PL has been removed since the 
      Module::Install support has been removed

0.55 Mon. April 28, 2008
    - All classes now have proper C3 MRO support
      - added MRO::Compat as a dependency to allow
        for the C3 MRO support to Just Work in all
        perl versions

    * Class::MOP::Class
      - rebless_instance now returns the instance
        it has just blessed, this is mostly to
        facilitate chaining
      - set the attr correctly in rebless_instance
        when it has no init_arg
      - tweaked &linear_isa and &class_precedence_list
        to support c3 classes.

0.54 Fri. March, 14, 2008
    * Class::MOP
      metaclass.pm
      - making sure that load_class never gets
        passed a value from @_ or $_ to squash
        Ovid's bug (http://use.perl.org/~Ovid/journal/35763)

    * Class::MOP::Class
      - make_{immutable,mutable} now return 1
        (cause Sartak asked)
      - improved error handling in ->create method
      - rebless_instance now takes extra params which
        will be used to populate values
        - added tests for this

    * Class::MOP::Object
      - localizing the Data::Dumper configurations so
        that it does not pollute others (RT #33509)

    * Class::MOP::Class
      Class::MOP::Package
      Class::MOP::Module
      Class::MOP::Method
      Class::MOP::Attribute
      - these classes no longer define their own ->meta,
        but instead just inherit from Class::MOP::Object

    * Class::MOP::Instance
      Class::MOP::Immutable
      - these classes now inherit from Class::MOP::Object

    * t/
      - fixed the filename length on several
        test files so we install on VMS better
        (RT #32295)
      - fixed incorrect use of catdir when it
        should be catfile (RT #32385)

0.53 Thurs. Feb. 14, 1008
    ~~ several doc. fixes and updates ~~

    * Class::MOP::Class
      Class::MOP::Method::Constructor
      Class::MOP::Attribute
        - making init_arg accept an undefined value
          to indicate that no constructor args can
          be passed (thanks to nothingmuch)
          - added tests for this
        - added attribute initializer attribute (rjbs)

    * Class::MOP.
        - making this use the new init_arg => undef
          feature instead of the silly hack from
          before (thanks to nothingmuch)

0.52 Tues. Jan. 22, 2008
    * Class::MOP::Class
      - fixed bug in rebless_instance
        (discovered by ash)

    * Class::MOP::Method::Constructor
      - removed assumptions about the existence of
        a &meta method

0.51 Mon. Jan. 14, 2008
    ~~~ some misc. doc. fixes ~~~
    ~~ updated copyright dates ~~

    * Class::MOP
      - now sets the IS_RUNNING_ON_5_10
        constant so that we can take advantage
        of some of the nice bits of 5.10

    * Class::MOP::Class
      - uses the IS_RUNNING_ON_5_10 flag to
        optimize the &linearized_isa method
        and avoid the hack/check for circular
        inheritence in &class_precedence_list
      - added rebless_instance method (Sartak)
        - added tests for this

    * Class::MOP::Immutable
      - the immutable class now keeps track of
        the transformer which immutablized it

    * Class::MOP::Instance
      - added rebless_instance_structure method (Sartak)
        - added tests for this

0.50 Fri. Dec. 21, 2007
    * Class::MOP::Class
      - fixed bug in immutable to make sure that
        transformation arguments are saved
        correctly (mst)
        - added tests for this

    * Class::MOP::Immutable
      - fixed a bug (see above)

    * Class::MOP::Attribute
      - some doc updates

0.49 Fri. Dec. 14, 2007
    !! Class::MOP now loads 2 x faster  !!
    !! with XS speedups (thanks konobi) !!

    * Class::MOP
      - removed the dependency on B
      - added two XS functions (thanks konobi)
        - get_code_info($code) which replaces all
          the B fiddling we were doing with
          faster/leaner XS level fiddling
        - check_package_cache_flag($pkg_name) which
          returns the PL_sub_generation variable to
          be used to help manage method caching.

          NOTE:
          In 5.10 or greater this will actually
          use the mro::get_pkg_gen instead to give
          even more accurate caching information.
          blblack++ for that stuff :)

    * Class::MOP::Class
      - added the &subclasses method (thanks rlb)
      - added the update_package_cache_flag and
        reset_package_cache_flag which help keep
        track of when we need to re-fetch the
        method map.
      - Several small improvements to take advantage
        of the new method map caching features

0.48 Mon. Nov. 26, 2007
    * Class::MOP::Attribute
      - fixed get_read/write_method to handle the
        HASH ref case, which makes the
        get_read/write_method_ref handle it too.
        - added more tests for this

0.47 Sat. Nov. 24, 2007
    * Class::MOP::Attribute
      - fixed misspelling in get_write_method_ref
        - added more tests for this

0.46 Fri. Nov. 23, 2007
    * Class::MOP::Class
      - added the linearized_isa method instead of constantly
        pruning duplicate classes (this will be even more
        useful in the 5.10-compat version coming soon)

    * Class::MOP::Attribute
      - added the get_read_method_ref and get_write_method_ref
        methods which allow you to retrieve a CODE ref which
        can always be used to read or write an attribute.

0.45 Thurs. Nov. 13, 2007
    * Class::MOP::Attribute
      - Fix error message on confess (groditi)

0.44 Thurs. Nov. 13, 2007
    - Apparently I didn't make dist correctly (groditi)

0.43 Thurs. Nov. 13, 2007
    * Class::MOP
      - Add support for the 'builder' attribute (groditi)

    * Class::MOP::Class
      - optimise metaclass-already-exists check in
        construct_class_instance (groditi)
      - duplicate check into initialize to save a
        call through (groditi)

    * Class::MOP::Attribute
      - Add support for the 'builder' attribute (groditi)
      - Make predicates check for the existence of a value, not whether
        it is defined (groditi)

    * Class::MOP::Instance
      - Make predicates check for the existence of a value, not whether
        it is defined (groditi)

    * Class::MOP::Method::Accessor
      - made this a subclass of Class::MOP::Method::Generated
        - removed the relevant attributes

    * Class::MOP::Method::Constructor
      - fixed the cached values we had to be more sane
      - made this a subclass of Class::MOP::Method::Generated
      - fixed generated constructor so it properly handles
        subclasses now.
        - added tests for this
      - added the option to allow for both inlined and
        non-inlined constructors.
      - Update inlined methods for builder and predicate changes (groditi)

    * Class::MOP::Method::Generated
      - added this class as an abstract base for the
        Class::MOP::Method::{Constructor,Accessor} classes
        - added tests for this

    *t/
      - Alter tests (005, 014 020, 021) for new builder addition (groditi)
      - Tests for new predicate behavior (and corrections to old tests) (groditi)

    *examples/
      - Update ArrayRef based class example to work with predicate changes

0.42 Mon. July 16, 2007
    !!! Horray for mst, he fixed it !!!

    * Class::MOP::Package
      - alter symbol table handling to deal with 5.8.x and 5.9.x

    * t/
      - Get rid of the crappy workaround from 0.40/41

0.41 Sun. July 15, 2007
    * t/
        Arghh!!! My TODO test didn't work, so I handle
        it manually now so that people can use this
        with 5.9.5/bleadperl without issue.

0.40 Tues, July 3, 2007
    * t/
      ~ marked a test in 003_methods.t as TODO
        for perl 5.9.5 (this test is irrelvant to
        the module functioning on 5.9.5 for the most
        part anyway)

0.39 Mon. June 18, 2007
    * Class::MOP::Immutable
      - added make_metaclass_mutable + docs (groditi)
      - removed unused variable
      - added create_immutable_transformer
        necessary for sane overloading of immutable behavior
         - tests for this (groditi)

    * Class::MOP::Class
      - Immutability can now be undone,
        added make_mutable + tests + docs (groditi)
      - Massive changes to the way Immutable is done
        for details see comments next to make_immutable
        This fixes a bug where custom metaclasses broke
        when made immutable. We are now keeping one immutable
        metaclass instance per metaclass instead of just one
        to prevent isa hierarchy corruption. Memory use will go
        up, but I suspect it will be neglible.
         - New tests added for this behavior.  (groditi)

0.38 Thurs. May 31, 2007
    ~~ More documentation updates ~~

    * Class::MOP::Package
      - we now deal with stub methods properly
        - added tests for this
      - fixed some tests failing on 5.9.5 (thanks blblack)

    * Class::MOP::Attribute
      - added get_read_method and get_write_method
        thanks to groditi for this code, tests
        and docs.
        - added tests and POD for this

    * Class::MOP::Class
      - fixed RT issue #27329, clone object now
        handles undef values correctly.
        - added tests for this
      - Corrected anon-class handling so that they
        will not get reaped when instances still
        exist which need to reference them. This is
        the correct behavior, hopefully this is an
        obscure enough feature that there are not too
        many work arounds out in the wild.
        - added tests for this by groditi
        - updated docs to explain this

    * metaclass
      - load custom metaclasses automatically (thanks groditi)
        - added tests for this behavior

0.37 Sat. March 10, 2007
    ~~ Many, many documentation updates ~~

    * Class::MOP
      - added &load_class and &is_class_loaded
        - added tests and docs for these

    * Class::MOP::Attribute
      - default now checks the instance with defined to
        avoid setting off bool-overloads (found by Carl Franks)

0.37_002
    * /t
      - bad name in a test, causing meaningless failuress.
        No other changes.

0.37_001

    ~~ GLOBAL CHANGES ~~
    - All attribute names are now consistent and follow Perl 6
      style (prefixed with the sigil, and ! as the twigil for
      private attrs). This should not affect any code, unless
      you broke encapsulation, in which case, it is your problem
      anyway.

    !! Class::MOP::Class::Immutable has been removed

    * Class::MOP::Method::Constructor
      - this has been moved out of Class::MOP::Class::Immutable
        and is a proper subclass of Class::MOP::Method now.

    * Class::MOP::Class
      - this module now uses Class::MOP::Immutable for the
        immutable transformation instead of
        Class::MOP::Class::Immutable.

    + Class::MOP::Immutable
      - this module now controls the transformation from a mutable
        to an immutable version of the class. Docs for this will
        be coming eventually.


0.36 Sun. Nov. 5, 2006
    * Class::MOP::Class
      - added a few 'no warnings' lines to keep annoying
        (and meaningless) warnings from chirping during
        global destruction.

    * Class::MOP
      - some more bootstrapping is now done on the new
        classes

    * Class::MOP::Class::Immutable
      *** API CHANGE ***
      - constructor generation is now handled by
        the Class::MOP::Method::Constructor class

    * Class::MOP::Method::Constructor
      - created this to handle constructor generation
        in Class::MOP::Class::Immutable

    * Class::MOP::Attribute
      *** API CHANGE ***
      - attributes now delegate to the
        Class::MOP::Method::Accessor to generate
        accessors

    * Class::MOP::Method::Accessor
      - all accessor generation functions from
        Class::MOP::Attribute have been moved here

0.35 Sat. Sept. 30, 2006

    * scripts/class_browser.pl
      - initial prototype of a class browser, more
        on this to come. Comments and patches are
        very much welcome.

    * Class::MOP
      - All Class::MOP::* accessors are no longer
        re-generated in the bootstrap, instead
        they are aliased from the originals
        - fixed tests to reflect
      - added Class::MOP::Method (and its subclasses)
        to the bootstrap
        - adjusted tests for this
      - added the Class::MOP::Instance attributes
        to the bootstrap

    * Class::MOP::Method
      *** API CHANGE ***
      - methods are no longer blessed CODE refs
        but are actual objects which can be CODE-ified
        - adjusted tests to compensate
        - adjusted docs for this

    * Class::MOP::Class
      - changed how methods are dealt with to
        encapsulate most of the work into the
        &get_method_map method
      - made several adjustments for the change
        in Class::MOP::Method
      - &add_attribute now checks if you are adding
        a duplicate name, and properly removes the
        old one before installing the new one
        - added tests for this
        - adjusted docs for this

    * Class::MOP::Class::Immutable
      - added caching of &get_method_map
      - fixed issue with &get_package_symbol
      - cleaned up the methods that die (patch by David Wheeler)

    * Class::MOP::Package
      - added filtering capabilities to
        &list_all_package_symbols

0.34 Sat. Aug. 26, 2006
    * Class::MOP::Class
      - added the %:methods attribute, which like
        the $:version and such just actually goes
        to the symbol table to get it's stuff.
        However, it makes the MOP more complete.
     ** API CHANGE **
      - The &create method now requires that all
        but the package name now is passed in as
        named parameters. See docs for more info.
        - updated docs and tests for this

    * Class::MOP::Object
      - added &dump method to easily Data::Dumper
        an object

    * Class::MOP
      - cleaned up the initialization of attributes

      - added the %:methods attribute definition to
        the bootstrap

    ~ lots of misc. test cleanup

0.33 Sat. Aug. 19, 2006
    * Class::MOP::Class
      - moved the metaclass cache out of here
        and it is now in Class::MOP itself.

    * Class::MOP
      - moved all the metaclass cache stuff here
        - fixed all tests for this

    * Class::MOP::Attribute
      - reference values (other than CODE refs)
        are no longer allowed for defaults
        - added tests for this

    * Class::MOP::Package
      - fixed an issue with perl 5.8.1 and how it deals
        with symbol tables. The namespace hash is now
        always reloaded from the symbol table.

    ~ lots of misc. documentation cleanup

0.32 Sat. Aug. 12, 2006
    + added Class::MOP::Object so that the
      metamodel is more complete (and closer
      to what Perl 6 will probably be).

    * Class::MOP::Package
      - refactored entire class, this is now
        the primary gateway between the metaclass
        and the Perl 5 symbol table
        - added many tests for this
      - this class is now a subclass of
        Class::MOP::Object
        - added some tests to reflect this

    * Class::MOP::Class
      - refactored all symbol table access to
        use Class::MOP::Package methods instead

    * Class::MOP::Module
      - adding the $:version attribute in the bootstrap
        so that Module has a version as an attribute
        - see comment in Class::MOP for details
      - added the $:authority attribute to this module
        as well as an &identifier method, to bring us
        ever closer to Perl 6 goodness
        - I have added $AUTHORITY to all the modules
        - added tests for this

    * Class::MOP::Instance
      - added &deinitialize_slot for removing slots
        from an instance
        - added tests for this

    * Class::MOP::Attribute
      - added support for &deinitialize_slot for removing
        slots from an instance
        - added tests for this

0.31 Sat. July 15, 2006

    * Class::MOP::Class
      - added &find_method_by_name to locate a method
        anywhere within the class hierarchy

    * Class::MOP::Attribute
      - added &set_value and &get_value for getting
        the value of the attribute for a particular
        instance.

0.30 Wed. July 5, 2006
    ---------------------------------------
    This is the first version of Class::MOP
    to introduce the immutable features which
    will be used for optimizating the MOP.
    This support should still be considered
    experimental, but moving towards stability.
    ---------------------------------------

    * Created Class::MOP::Class::Immutable

    * Created the Class::MOP::Package and
      Class::MOP::Module classes to more
      closely conform to Perl 6's meta-model

    * Class::MOP::Class
      - now inherits from Class::MOP::Module
      - several methods moved to ::Module and
        ::Package and now inherited
        - added tests for this

    * Class::MOP::Instance
      - added an is_inlinable method to allow other
        classes to check before they attempt to optimize.
      - added an inline_create_instance to inline
        instance creation (of course)

    ** API CHANGE **
      - the Class::MOP::Class::*_package_variable
        methods are all now methods of Class::MOP::Package
        and called *_package_symbol instead. This is
        because they are now more general purpose symbol
        table manipulation methods.

0.29_02 Thurs. June 22, 2006
    ++ DEVELOPER RELEASE ++
    * Class::MOP::Class
      - small change in &create so that it behaves
        properly when inherited
      - small fix to &clone_instance

0.29_01 Fri. May 12, 2006
    ++ DEVELOPER RELEASE ++
      - This release works in combination with
        Moose 0.09_01, it is a developer release
        because it introduces a new instance
        sub-protocol and has not yet been
        optimized.

    * Class::MOP::Class
      - anon-classes are now properly garbage collected
        - added tests for this
      - improved method modifier wrapping

    * Class::MOP::Instance
      - added new instance protocol
        - added tests for this
      - changed all relevant modules and examples
        - Class::MOP::Class
        - Class::MOP::Attribute
        - examples/*

    * metaclass
      - you no longer need to specify the metaclass
        itself, if it is not there, Class::MOP::Class
        is just assumed
        - updated tests for this

    * examples/
      - added ArrayBasedStorage example to show
        instance storage using ARRAY refs instead of
        HASH refs.
        - added tests for this
      - InsideOutClass is totally revised using the
        new instance protocol
        - added more tests for this

0.26 Mon. April 24, 2006
    * Class::MOP::Class
      - added find_attribute_by_name method
        - added tests and docs for this
      - some small optimizations

    * Class::MOP::Attribute
      - some small optimizations

0.25 Thurs. April 20, 2006
    * Class::MOP::Class
      - added create_anon_class for creating anonymous classes
        - added tests for this
      - added get_all_metaclasses, get_all_metaclass_names
        and get_all_metaclass_instances method to allow
        access to all the cached metaclass objects.
      - attribute slot initialization is now the responsibility
        of the attribute itself, and construct_instance now
        delegates appropriately

    * Class::MOP::Attribute
      - attribute slot initialization is now the responsibility
        of the attribute itself, so we added a method for it
        called initialize_instance_slot

    * examples/
      - adjusted all the examples to use the new attribute
        initialize_instance_slot method

0.24 Tues. April 11, 2006
    * Class::MOP::Class
      - cleaned up how the before/after/around method
        modifiers get named with Sub::Name

0.23 Thurs. March 30, 2006
	* Class::MOP::Class
	  - fixed the way attribute defaults are handled
	    during instance construction (bug found by chansen)

	* Class::MOP::Attribute
	  - read-only accessors ('reader') will now die if
	    passed more than one argument (attempting to write
	    to them basically)
	      - added tests for this
	      - adjusted all /example files to comply

0.22 Mon. March 20, 2006
    * Class::MOP::Class
      - localized $@ in the *_package_variable functions
        because otherwise, it does ugly things in Moose.
          - added test case for this

0.21 Wed. March 15, 2006
    * Class::MOP::Class
      - fixed issue where metaclasses are reaped from
        our cache in global destruction, and so are not
        available in DESTORY calls

0.20 Thurs. March 2, 2006
    - removed the dependency for Clone since
      we no longer to deep-cloning by default.

    * Class::MOP::Method
      - added &package_name, &name and
        &fully_qualified_name methods, some of
        which were formerly private subs in
        Class::MOP::Class

    * Class::MOP::Method::Wrapped
      - allows for a method to be wrapped with
        before, after and around modifiers
          - added tests and docs for this feature

    * Class::MOP::Class
      - improved &get_package_symbol
          - &version and &superclasses now use it
      - methods are now blessed into Class::MOP::Method
        whenever possible
      - added methods to install CLOS-style method modifiers
         - &add_before_method_modifier
         - &add_after_method_modifier
         - &add_around_method_modifier
             - added tests and docs for these
      - added &find_next_method_by_name which finds the
        equivalent of SUPER::method_name

0.12 Thurs. Feb 23, 2006
    - reduced the dependency on B, no need to always
      have the latest

    * examples/
      - added docs to the C3 method dispatch order test
      - fixed missing Algorithm::C3 dependency by making
        the test skip if it is not installed

0.11 Mon Feb. 20, 2006
    * examples/
      - added example of changing method dispatch order to C3

    * Class::MOP::Class
      - changed how clone_instance behaves, it now only does a
        shallow clone (see docs for more details)
        - added docs and tests

0.10 Tues Feb. 14, 2006
    ** This release was mostly about writing more tests and
       cleaning out old and dusty code, the MOP should now
       be considered "ready to use".

    - adding more tests to get coverage up a little higher,
      mostly testing errors and edge cases.
      - test coverage is now at 99%

    * Class::MOP
      - no longer optionally exports to UNIVERSAL::meta or
        creates a custom metaclass generator, use the
        metaclass pragma instead.

    * Class::MOP::Class
      - fixed a number of minor issues which came up in the
        error/edge-case tests

    * Class::MOP::Attribute
      - fixed a number of minor issues which came up in the
        error/edge-case tests

    * examples/
      - fixing the AttributesWithHistory example, it was broken.

0.06 Thurs Feb. 9, 2006
    * metaclass
      - adding new metaclass pragma to make setting up the
        metaclass a little more straightforward

    * Class::MOP
      - clean up bootstrapping to include more complete
        attribute definitions for Class::MOP::Class and
        Class::MOP::Attribute (accessors, readers, writers,
        etc.) ... it is redundant, but is useful meta-info
        to have around.

    * Class::MOP::Class
      - fixing minor meta-circularity issue with &meta, it
        is now more useful for subclasses
      - added &get_attribute_map as an accessor for the
        hash of attribute meta objects
      - &compute_all_applicable_attributes now just returns
        the attribute meta-object, rather than the HASH ref
        since all the same info can be gotten from the
        attribute meta-object itself
          - updated docs & tests to reflect
      - added &clone_instance method which does a deep clone
        of the instance structure created by &construct_instance
          - added docs & tests for this
          - added Clone as a dependency
      - added &new_object and &clone_object convience methods to
        return blessed new or cloned instances
          - they handle Class::MOP::Class singletons correctly too
          - added docs & tests for this
      - cleaned up the &constuct_class_instance so that it behaves
        more like &construct_instance (and managed the singletons too)
      - added the &check_metaclass_compatibility method to make sure
        that metaclasses are upward and downward compatible.
          - added tests and docs for this

    * examples/
      - adjusting code to use the &Class::MOP::Class::meta
        fix detailed above
      - adjusting code to use the metaclass pragma

0.05 Sat Feb. 4, 2006
    * Class::MOP::Class
      - added the &attribute_metaclass and &method_metaclass
        attributes which contain a metaclass name to use for
        attributes/methods respectively

    * Class::MOP
      - bootstrap additional attributes for Class::MOP::Class

    * examples/
      - adjusted the example code and tests to use the new
        &attribute_metaclass feature of Class::MOP::Class
      - added new example:
        - LazyClass

0.04 Fri Feb. 3, 2006
    * Class::MOP::Class
      - some documentation suggestions from #perl6

    - converted to Module::Build instead of EU::MM

    * Class::MOP::Attribute
      - refactored method generation code
      - attributes are now associated with class directly

    * examples/
      - refactored the InsideOut example to take advantage
        of the Class::MOP::Attribute refactoring
      - changed example files to .pod files and hide thier
        package names from PAUSE (I don't want to own these
        namespaces really, they are just examples)

0.02 Thurs Feb. 2, 2006
    - moving examples from t/lib/* to examples/*
        - adding POD documentation to the examples

0.01 Thurs Feb. 2, 2006
