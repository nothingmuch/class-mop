=head1 NAME

Class::MOP::Method::Attribute - Method Meta Object for accessors

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Class::MOP::Method::Accessor;

    my $reader = Class::MOP::Method::Accessor->new(
        attribute     => $attribute,
        is_inline     => 1,
        accessor_type => 'reader',
    );

    $reader->body->execute($instance); # call the reader method

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a subclass of <Class::MOP::Method> which is used by
C<Class::MOP::Attribute> to generate accessor code. It handles
generation of readers, writers, predicates and clearers. For each type
of method, it can either create a subroutine reference, or actually
inline code by generating a string and C<eval>'ing it.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item B<< Class::MOP::Method::Accessor->new(%options) >>

This returns a new C<Class::MOP::Method::Accessor> based on the
C<%options> provided.

=over 4

=item * attribute

This is the C<Class::MOP::Attribute> for which accessors are being
generated. This option is required.

=item * accessor_type

This is a string which should be one of "reader", "writer",
"accessor", "predicate", or "clearer". This is the type of method
being generated. This option is required.

=item * is_inline

This indicates whether or not the accessor should be inlined. This
defaults to false.

=item * name

The method name (without a package name). This is required.

=item * package_name

The package name for the method. This is required.

=back

=item B<< $metamethod->accessor_type >>

Returns the accessor type which was passed to C<new>.

=item B<< $metamethod->is_inline >>

Returns a boolean indicating whether or not the accessor is inlined.

=item B<< $metamethod->associated_attribute >>

This returns the L<Class::MOP::Attribute> object which was passed to
C<new>.

=item B<< $metamethod->body >>

The method itself is I<generated> when the accessor object is
constructed.
